# WebScraper

Built using PyCharm, Pandas, beautifulsoup, and selenium. Scrape cars.com for cars of your choice. User imputs if they want a used or new car. Then the car make, model, distance from home they are willing to drive, and the max price they will pay. Then the code opens a driver, goes to cars.com, imputs the users inputs into a fields. Then writes down the cars listing title and price onto a CSV file.

In the future I will add:
- Allow user to input how many pages they want to scrape
- CSV file will return url of each listing
